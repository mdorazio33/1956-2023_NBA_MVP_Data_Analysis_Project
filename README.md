# 1956-2023_NBA_MVP_Data_Analysis_Project
Hello everyone! This repository details a cool project I did analyzing the MVP winners from the National Basketball Association throughout the 1956 to 2023 NBA seasons along with my findings.

It contains a detailed analysis along with a set of visualizations I created for a mid-semester project in my Visual Analytics course during the Fall of 2023.

The analysis and visualizations seen in this project were created primarily through the use of the pandas and matplotlib libraries and the .csv file I used will be included in this repository as well.

Enjoy!
